**S:** As new members entered the team, our current branch strategy with only `main` and `dev` wasn't sufficient anymore.

**T:** Create a scalable, easy-to-maintain branching strategy that improved collaboration and reduced merge conflicts.

**A:** With those requirements in mind, I proposed a solution to the team and we refined it together. We adapted existing solutions to our needs, keeping it simple and testing the process in a sandbox. All the conventions decided upon were documented.

**R:** Established a robust versioning process with standardized branch naming, commit, and PR conventions. Collaboration and delivery speed improved through clearer structure and reduced friction.
